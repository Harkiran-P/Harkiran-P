          Hi! I'm Harkiran, a computer science student based in London. I've found my true passion to be within the gaming industry and how we can use AI to enhance user experiences but I explore all areas of computer science to really hone my ability as a programmer.

        -  🥋 Outside of my tech pursuits, I'm a taekwondo athlete!<br>
        -  🎬 I love movies and draw a lot of inspiration from their ideas!<br>
        -  ♥️ As much as I look towards the future of gaming, I think there's some games that will always remain a favourite. I'll always return to Tetris!<br>
